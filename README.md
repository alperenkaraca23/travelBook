# travelBook

<li> You can think of this app as a travel book. My goal was to create an application that allows us to save locations and take notes of places we remember in a city we visit. </li>
<li> In this application, I learned and used Apple's MapKit framework. I stored the locations we recorded as CoreData. </li>
<li> I started making my application from Mapkit settings. First, after creating the application interface, I added Mapkit. After making the MapKit settings, I created an annotation. And I created a gesture recognizer so that when a place is clicked for 3 seconds, an annotation is added. </li>
<li> And then I made the CoreData settings. First, I ensured that information such as location and title were received and saved. </li>
<li> I then created the page that would display these saved locations. I have ensured that the information we have recorded on this page is withdrawn.After showing this information to our user, I directed these locations to the maps with the button next to the annotation, so that the routes from the user's location to that location could be shown. </li>
<li> Finally, after checking the features of the save button, I completed my application by activating the delete button. </li>
